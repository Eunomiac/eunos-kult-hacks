**Key Considerations for Chapter Three (Overview Only)**

(Review relevant project files for more detailed context.)

- **Involving Everyone**
  - We can leave Alistair out of the East Tunnel expedition altogether if including him starts to feel shoehorned or unnecessary. Embracing the idea of a split party for part of the session can create compelling parallel storylines and encourage everyone to focus on what drives their characters in that moment. Meanwhile, Alistair’s personal arc with his mother can carry just as much depth, reinforcing his own sense of isolation and mystery within Emma’s Rise.
  - **Elijah** remains straightforward to entice via the Tallyman or a peculiar ritual undercurrent—anything that highlights his tenuous pact and challenges his sense of identity. Drawing him in can be done through a cryptic omen or direct entreaty from the Tallyman.
  - **Jesus** needs a more pressing push to venture into the perilous East Tunnel. Perhaps a piece of crucial information surfaces—a direct threat to his safety or a hint that confronting the Tallyman here might finally offer clarity or relief from his constant dread. If it’s time-sensitive, Jesus is likelier to take the risk.
  - **Roman** already has both practical and spiritual reasons to accompany Morgan, thanks to his guide role and his personal search for answers in Emma’s Rise.

- **Dramatic Hooks**
  - Everyone’s current hooks intersect well with either the subterranean environment or personal story beats that can manifest there—Tallyman sightings, supernatural illusions, or repressed memories.
  - Make sure to sprinkle in small, scene-driven moments that let each PC see glimpses of what they need to explore emotionally, giving them a chance to push forward and claim the XP reward for fulfilling those hooks. If Jesus briefly spies the Tallyman’s silhouette among dripping cavern walls, or Roman loses control in a claustrophobic pinch, those payoffs happen naturally.

- **Agency & Choices**
  - Maintain an open-ended structure within the cave or surrounding paths, avoiding railroading. Maybe the group can choose between multiple passageways, or they can decide whether to press deeper into the gloom or exit early if the risk is too intense.
  - Actively invite them to brainstorm their own tactics when faced with environmental or supernatural hazards, so the session dynamic emerges from their decisions rather than a strictly linear flow of set pieces.

- **Supernatural Ties**
  - Layer illusions, minor hauntings, and symbolic references to each PC’s Dark Secret throughout the environment. Morgan might find a broken scientific instrument reminiscent of his lost team, or Jesus might hear faint chanting reminiscent of Tallyman’s haunting presence. For Elijah, the hush of the cave could be punctuated by an otherworldly voice calling him “Master.”
  - Keep these manifestations consistent so players sense a purposeful design behind them. Let them question: Is the Tallyman’s power stronger underground, or are they all just closer to some metaphysical boundary?

- **Tone & Atmosphere**
  - Amplify claustrophobia and tension with shadow-choked corridors, echoing drips, and the unshakable sense that they’re trespassing in a place where illusions bleed into reality. Scenes of near-drowning or hairline collapses can push the horror element without relying solely on random combat or monsters.
  - Intertwine their personal nightmares so no one’s storyline feels sidelined. The East Tunnel should be a crucible for the campaign’s supernatural stakes. A single session that merges as many nightmares as possible will heighten intensity while still giving them control to shape outcomes.
