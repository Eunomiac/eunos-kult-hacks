# MORGAN HARVEY, "THE PEERLESS PARIAH"
Morgan Harvey was once a rising scholar at Western Kentucky University. Specializing in fieldwork far more than lecture halls, he led expeditions into the wild in pursuit of his real obsession: the mysterious, poorly documented telluric currents that pulse beneath the earth’s surface. When Harvey detected an impossible triple-convergence during a routine student expedition, he followed it into an uncharted cave system—only to emerge alone, his entire student team vanished without explanation. Acquitted of criminal negligence but shunned by his peers, Harvey’s professional reputation was all but destroyed. Still, his drive to understand the subterranean forces that upended his life—and the terrifying darkness he witnessed—has not diminished.

## Dark Secret: "Returned from the Other Side"
Harvey’s ill-fated cave expedition revealed an impossibility: a convergence of telluric currents in a place they simply shouldn’t have existed. Venturing deeper, he and his students encountered a darkness beyond darkness—an entity so black it seemed to devour light itself. Over five days of terror, one student after another vanished into the labyrinth, furtively wandering off as if of their own volition without a word. Only Harvey made it out. Though no evidence supported claims of wrongdoing, academia turned on him. Ostracized and plagued by guilt, he can neither explain nor forget what happened in the depths.

## Personal Drive
Discover the truth of what happened in those caves.

## How Morgan Got to Emma's Rise
Desperate to rebuild his career and make sense of the forces he once studied, Harvey began sending out signals through the telluric lines, hoping for any sign of a new convergence. To his astonishment, he detected an unprecedented seven-wave convergence in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Mayor JIM WAINWRIGHT of Emma’s Rise then contacted him, pleading for expert help with a stalled survey tunnel. Hearing the exact coordinates that matched the convergence sealed Harvey’s decision. Enlisting a guide through the local park rangers led him to ROMAN LARSON (another PC) —who agreed without pause the instant Harvey mentioned Emma’s Rise, as if awaiting that call.

## Timeline
- ~5–7 Years Ago — Earns graduate degree; becomes an adjunct professor at Western Kentucky University; begins leading field trips.
- ~3–4 Years Ago — Grows obsessed with telluric currents; develops detection methods; publishes initial findings to a lukewarm reception.
- ~1½–2 Years Ago — Discovers triple-wave convergence in a rural location; diverts student expedition to investigate.
5 Days in the Caves — Encounters an “impossible darkness”; students vanish one by one; Harvey alone emerges.
- ~1–1½ Years Ago — Legal inquests clear him of wrongdoing; ostracized by academia; loses tenure-track prospects.
- ~6–9 Months Ago — Continues personal research; begins broadcasting signals through telluric lines, searching for new anomalies.
- ~1–2 Months Ago — Detects a seven-wave convergence in the Black Hills; receives a desperate call from Mayor Jim Wainwright of Emma’s Rise.
- Present Day — Travels to Emma’s Rise with local guide Roman Larson; hopes to uncover the truth behind the darkness and the fate of his students.

## Significant NPCs
### Mayor Jim Wainwright
As a member of one of Emma's Rise's three founding families (along with the Kingsgraves and the Holts), Jim Wainwright's position as Mayor of Emma's Rise illustrates that the balance of power in Emma's Rise is in the Wainwright's hands... at least for the moment. The mayor is honest and sincere in his dealings: He really does want to create an escape from Emma's Rise through the digging of the East Tunnel, and thus opposes both the Kingsgraves and the Holts, who want to preserve Emma's Rise as a sanctuary for the Old Willow. As the cataclysm of the Approaching Now continues to worsen in Emma's Rise, Mayor Wainwright has lost some of his confidence: He fears he may destroy the town before he is able to escape it, but for now he presses forward resolutely despite this worry.

### The Lost Students
This is tentative, but I'm toying with the idea of having Morgan be the reason his students wandered off in those caves: Since Emma's Rise moves backwards in time, "Emma's Rise Morgan" could influence the events in "Elysium Morgan"'s past.  While investigating the East Tunnel in Emma's Rise, I'm thinking he'll start seeing his old students, and every time he finds one, that student is brought into Emma's Rise (vanishing from the real world, baffling the past Morgan Harvey).
