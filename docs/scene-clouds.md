| battered "Station #1" sign half-swallowed by moss | smell of ozone and old sweat |
| gravel crunches like breaking glass underfoot | windows fogged from within, smeared by fingers |
| antennae rising like skeletal fingers | blackened pine needles clumped in the gutters |

| boots on wood—deliberate, too calm | "Did you *walk* here? Out of the Wending?" |
| young man in ranger greens, already sweating | unsmiling face twisted in disbelief |
| air charged like a held breath | "You're not supposed to be real." |
| he steps out like he's meeting a ghost | rifle slung but unlatched |
| silence around the station feels arranged | nameplate twisted, unreadable |
