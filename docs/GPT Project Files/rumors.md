# Rumors
Every few days, I post to our Discord server a vague teaser about the mysteries of the campaign in the form of a rumor: a snippet of overheard conversation from the townsfolk of Emma's Rise, or a cryptic puzzle, etc.

I will keep this document updated with each rumor as it is posted.

## List of Rumors


- SEVEN TRUTHS AND THREE LIES:
<br>1. The Kingsgraves are a rot that threatens us all.
<br>2. Only three outsiders accompany you to Emma's Rise, not four.
<br>3. Beware the pitiless gaze of the Black Sun.
<br>4. Emma's Rise is as old as Elysium itself.
<br>5. The East Tunnel is a lie.
<br>6. From Ambergris Peak, the Great Mother watches.
<br>7. The Hollowood has no trees.
<br>8. Wayward souls sow dissent even here.
<br>9. Until now, no outsider has ever visited Emma's Rise.
<br>10. You are the only person to have ever left Emma's Rise.
  - This first rumor posted was a companion to ALISTAIR KINGSGRAVE's curious interplay between his "Schizophrenic" and "Repressed Memories" Disadvantages: When a memory ostensibly surfaces from his past, he can't be sure if it's real or imagined. Rather than give him a coin toss, I decided to be more interesting and weight things as "seven truths" and "three lies".
  - The three lies are:
    - 2. Only three outsiders accompany you to Emma's Rise, not four.
    - 9. Until now, no outsider has ever visited Emma's Rise.
    - 10. You are the only person to have ever left Emma's Rise.

- "We are of the Pact and the Promise, guided by the wendings of Rowan, Ash, and Yew; of Juniper, Hawthorn, Birch, and Oak; of Hemlock, Aspen, and Willow"
  - This is part of the oath taken by the Kin, and includes the names of the ten Old Trees.
- "I have never seen the stars."
  - This is a hint about the cataclysmic lightning storm and perpetual daylight (in the form of a frozen nuclear fireball hanging over the Hollowood) that bathes Emma's Rise at all times.
- "The Hollowood has no trees."
  - The Hollowood is actually a forest of crystal columns, each containing a human body in suspended animation.
- "To travel a wending is to never return."
  - This is likely a lie, but it is certainly something many of the townsfolk believe. ELIJAH MONTGOMERY LEE is proof that it is possible to return from a wending; the Kin do it all the time.
- " ... which is why, in a sense both figurative and literal, I'm a time traveller from the future."
  - This hints at the temporal mechanics of Emma's Rise, namely that the town travels backwards through time. Everyone present in Emma's Rise when the players arrive is necessarily from the future, making them all "time travellers from the future."
- "... continuing our initiative to increase the number of defibrillators located throughout our town, to mitigate the impact of ..."
  - This emphasizes the mysteriously high number of defibrillators in Emma's Rise, which is one of the safety measures against the cataclysmic lightning storm.
- "With the Ash-Juniper War entering its third year, it is incumbent upon me as your ..."
  - This hints at factions and dissension between the ten Old Trees. The Old Ash is the "Tree of Secrets", and the Old Juniper is the "Tree of Revelation", which explains why they are at odds.
- "One of our town's most cherished traditions continues to bring communities together! Every spring, Emma's Rise welcomes guests from our twin cities Birao and Chokurdakh for our annual citizen exchange program. Visitors are treated to local hospitality, including the ceremonial gathering at the historic Old Willow, where they are hoisted up into its ancient branches and burned alive."
  - A hint at how unified the townsfolk are, even when it comes to traditions that are, in a sense, barbaric. It suggests there are strong reasons for these traditions, and that the players should be wary of them.
- "... are you supposed to know when it's nighttime ..."
  - This is another hint about the cataclysmic lightning storm and perpetual daylight (in the form of a frozen nuclear fireball hanging over the Hollowood) that bathes Emma's Rise at all times.
- "... serious and compassionate deliberation, it is the determination of this Council that Gunthrie McKnight is wayward. Jurisdiction thus remands to the Pact, which is unambiguous on the matter of sentencing and leaves this Council with no recourse but to ..."
  - This is the first mention of the "wayward" phenomenon, which is a degenerative condition that afflicts only men, causing them to "disconnect" from the reversed timeline of Emma's Rise.  It is most commonly triggered by being struck by lightning (the many defibrillators are actually machines intended to prevent the wayward condition from taking root).  If interventions fail, the wayward is instantly trapped in a time loop: the new wayward might live the next several days, months, or years a thousand times over before "emerging" from the time loop mere seconds after being struck (from the perspective of an outside observer).  Much like Bill Murray's character near the end of _Groundhog Day_ or Tom Cruise in _Edge of Tomorrow_, the wayward becomes impossibly adept at navigating whatever period of time they were trapped looping through, making them a serious threat should they intend harm. Worse, the mental trauma of living potentially thousands of lives in a single day is so great that the wayward are frequently driven to madness.  This madness, combined with the wayward's sudden mastery of the local environment, makes them an extremely dangerous threat to the townsfolk.
- "Why is this happening?!  Why is it just one thing, after another, after another?!  Why can't they stop! Why can't they leave us alone?! I am so fucking scared. Oh I am so fucking scared..."
  - This was just intended to raise the tension, emphasizing that, at least to some townsfolk, their situation is dire and there are threats from without they are terrified of.
- GERARD FLEMMING ◆ RANGER ⅪⅩ ◆ 1802 — 1819<br>— weathered Standing Stones inscription
  - This refers to "Ranger Nineteen", which ROMAN LARSON encountered on Willow's Wending during CHAPTER ONE. Ranger Nineteen was clearly equipped with futuristic technology, and this inscription indicates that he was present in Emma's Rise far in the past (i.e. far into Elysium's future).
- "... can't do that. We're down to a single dermal regenerator, and its days are numbered.  I'll set the bone and give you something for the pain, but the only other healing you'll be getting is bed rest ..."
  - This hints at the presents of future technology in Emma's Rise, as well as how such technology behaves much like old tech does in Elysium -- since time moves in reverse, "future" technology actually came from Emma's Rise's distant past.
- THE TEN TREES AND THEIR WENDINGS:
<br>1. Old Birch, "the Tree of Dawn" — Kronotsky Nature Reserve, Kamchatka, Russia
<br>2. Old Rowan, "the Tree of Ways" — Paro Taktsang, Paro District, Bhutan
<br>3. Old Ash, "the Tree of Secrets" — Rollright Stones, Oxfordshire, England
<br>4. Old Juniper, "the Tree of Revelation" — Mount Kōya, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan
<br>5. Old Hawthorn, "the Tree of Rapture" — Jebel Toubkal, High Atlas Mountains, Morocco
<br>6. Old Willow, "the Tree of Memory" — Black Hills, South Dakota, USA
<br>7. Old Aspen, "the Tree of Echoes" — Lake St. Clair, Tasmania, Australia
<br>8. Old Hemlock, "the Tree of Sorrow" — Mount Emei, Sichuan Province, China
<br>9. Old Yew, "the Tree of Endings" — Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve, Querétaro, Mexico
<br>10. Old Oak, "the Tree of Forever" — Monteverde Cloud Forest, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica
  - I decided to reveal the nature of the ten Old Trees in this rumor, because it is a fun bit of worldbuilding that emphasizes the global importance of the ten Old Trees.
- "... hear the Bells went silent mid-ring last week? Neither did I, but Sam is adamant that the whole town froze like statues for nearly five whole ..."
  - This hints at the differing perspectives townsfolk have of time in Emma's Rise (perhaps Sam is "going wayward" and is beginning to show symptoms of disconnecting from the reversed timeline). It's also a reminder of "the Bells", which has been cryptically mentioned as a frequent and mandatory event in Emma's Rise.
