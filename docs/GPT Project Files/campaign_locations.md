# Emma's Rise Districts

**1. THE WENDING**
  As with every sanctuary of one of the Ten Trees, a _wending_ is the only way in or out of the town.  Here, **Willow's Wending** is shrouded in mist and legend; its existence is not acknowledged by maps or GPS. Travel along its treacherous path is perilous, and it is believed that only those with the blessing of the **Old Willow** will survive the journey.  If they do, they will first encounter **Ranger Station #1**, where rangers stationed there provide aid and information.
**2. THE TOWN CENTER**
  The center of the town, where most of the administrative and commercial buildings of Emma's Rise are situated.
**3. THE THREE FAMILY ESTATES: KINGSGRAVE, HOLT, AND WAINWRIGHT**
  Three families have always held sway over the town of Emma's Rise: The Kingsgraves, The Holts, and The Wainwrights.  Each of these families has a large estate in the town, and each of their estates is a nexus of power and influence in the town.
**4. THE TWO HILLS: ASH HILL AND BEACON HILL**
  The topography of Emma's Rise is mostly flat, but for two hills: **Ash Hill** and **Beacon Hill**, interspersed between the estates of the three families.
**5. THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT**
  A relatively large area at the southern edge of the town containing many single-family homes and the occasional apartment building. At its farthest southeast corner is a small public park displaying the statue of the Weeping King.
**6. THE EAST TUNNEL**
  A tunnel under construction south of the Hollowood, intended to connect Emma's Rise to the outside world.  It is currently unfinished, Mayor Jim Wainwright having recently fired the Modwen Group in favor of hiring the geologist Morgan Harvey.
**7. THE HOLLOWOOD & VICINITY**
  On the west side of town, opposite **Willow's Wending**, the Hollowood is concealed by the blazing actinic light that shines like a nuclear fireball suspended in time over the entire town. Even closely approaching the Hollowood doesn't reveal much, for the light thwarts even the most advanced protective gear. Likely the location of the mysterious community of **Ambergris**.

- **Emma's Rise Primary School**
  The town’s main primary school, sometimes used for large events, before students proceed to **Wainwright Academy** proper.
- **Emma's Rise School for Wayward Boys**
  The most secure facility in the town, this "school" is a containment facility for the "wayward" -- boys struck by the omnipresent lightning and shaken loose from the temporal bubble surrounding Emma's Rise for enough time to live the future as a repeating loop of potentially infinite length. After "emerging" from this eternity-in-an-eyeblink, the wayward are not only left entirely insane, but possessed with near perfect knowledge of whatever period of future time they looped through, and the mastery of all skills and knowledge they learned in that time.

# THE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

- **The Weeping King**
  A statue of a weeping king located at the far end of the residential district, in a small park set out for its display. It was hinted in the Town Newsletter that vandals had recently defaced the statue, but beyond that little else is known.

# THE EAST TUNNEL

- **East Tunnel**
  Incomplete tunnel project meant to link Emma’s Rise to the outside world; delays are a central town mystery.
  - **Mysterious Machine Room**
    The room at the end of the tunnel where impossibly active machinery was recently discovered, of a strange design that seems to hybridize futuristic technology with industrial-era pumps, gears and turbines.  Its purpose is unknown, however Mayor Jim Wainwright firmly believes that it is the key to ending the temporal bubble that forces Emma's Rise to move backwards through time.

# THE HOLLOWOOD & VICINITY
  - **Old Willow**
  One of the Ten Trees, powerful nexuses of mysterious power located around the world. The Old Willow, also known as "the Tree of Memory", is central to whatever power is responsible for the existence of Emma's Rise as well as its many strange characteristics.
  - **Pact Grove**
  A sacred grove located near the **Old Willow**, where the town's most important traditions and rituals are conducted.
  - **The Creek** and **Old Bridge**
  A natural waterway roughly separating the town proper from the Hollowood has always been known simply as "the Creek".  It is crossed at only one location, **Old Bridge**, a structure older than anyone in the town can recall.
- **Standing Stones**
  Across **Old Bridge** and down a short path lies a grove of ancient standing stones, though they are only actually _there_ half of the time: The Standing Stones are shared between the citizens of Emma's Rise and the people of Ambergris, and when the Standing Stones are in the care of Ambergris, they vanish to some unknown destination.  The Standing Stones contain instructions to the people of Emma's Rise and Ambergris: details on sacrifices, rituals, warnings, prophecies, and other cryptic messages.
- **Ranger Station #4**
  Located past the **Standing Stones** right on the frontier of the Hollowood.  Only the hardiest and most stable rangers are stationed here, for they face the madness of the Hollowood most directly.
