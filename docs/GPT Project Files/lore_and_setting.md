# Kult: Divinity Lost — Core Lore Reference
*Optimized for fast lookup and cross-referencing*

---

## 1. Cosmology Overview
- **Humanity was once divine, now imprisoned in a false reality (“Elysium”).**
- **The Demiurge:** Creator of the prison, architect of humanity’s fall.
- **Archons (10):** Enforce “Principles” that bind reality and shackle humanity.
- **Astaroth:** Demiurge’s dark twin, ruler of Inferno (the underworld/reflection).
- **Death Angels (10):** Dark mirrors of the Archons, each with a twisted Principle.
- **The Illusion:** The “real world” as perceived by mortals; designed to obscure truth and maintain control.
- **Truth:** Piercing the Illusion reveals the prison’s true nature and humanity’s lost divinity.

## 2. Realms / Worlds
- **Elysium:**
  - The everyday, “normal” world; a metaphysical prison for humanity.
  - Controlled and shaped by the Illusion.
  - “Thin spots” or weak places exist (slums, war zones, insane asylums, ritual sites) where the Illusion can tear, revealing Truth or opening passages to other realms.
- **Metropolis:**
  - The primordial, eternal city; humanity’s original home.
  - Vast, ruined, and labyrinthine, ruled by Archons, haunted by Angels, and stalked by azghouls (rebellious slaves).
  - Time and space are mutable here; can cross back to Elysium at different times/places.
- **Inferno:**
  - The underworld; reflection of Metropolis ruled by Astaroth and the Death Angels.
  - A place of horror, suffering, torture, and strange beauty.
  - Contains Purgatories: personal hells for sinners, sometimes overlapping with Elysium.

## 3. Core Metaphysics
- **The Illusion:**
  - Maintains the prison of Elysium.
  - Composed of lies, distractions, and enforced ignorance.
  - Enforced by Principles, powered by Archons and Death Angels.
  - Cracks at sites of trauma, supernatural events, or intense emotion.
- **Principles:**
  - Abstract cosmic laws, each aligned with an Archon (and mirrored by a Death Angel).
  - Examples: Law, Death, the Machine, the Wild, the Dream, etc.
- **Borderliners:**
  - Beings or phenomena that exist at the boundaries between Elysium and other realms.
- **Angels:**
  - Once servitors of the Demiurge, now scattered, broken, and rare.
- **Azghouls:**
  - Monsters created by humanity in Metropolis, now hostile and uncontrollable.

## 4. Key Factions/Entities
- **The Demiurge:**
  - No longer present (missing or dead); created the prison and established the system.
- **The Archons:**
  - 10 principal cosmic jailers; each governs a Principle.
  - Examples (canonical): Binah (Death), Geburah (War), Tiphareth (Beauty), etc.
- **The Death Angels:**
  - 10 antagonistic entities; each reflects a Principle in a perverse way.
- **Astaroth:**
  - Reigning god of Inferno; antithesis to the Demiurge.
  - His influence seeps into Elysium and corrupts it further.
- **Other Beings:**
  - Numerous supernatural creatures inhabit all realms (see main rulebook for specifics; cross-reference your bestiary or creature files).

## 5. Rules/Gameplay Notes
- The Illusion can be “torn” by trauma, magic, or passionate experience; this is the main way mortals glimpse Truth or access the supernatural.
- “Madness” or breaking free from the Illusion carries a price: destabilization, alienation, risk of discovery by jailers.
- Some mortals and monsters can cross between realms or break the rules of reality, but always at great risk.
