## PILLARS OF EMMA’S RISE
### Jim Wainwright – Mayor, Head of the Wainwright Family (ID:npc_jim_wainwright)
- **Home:** —
- **Work:** Town Hall
- **Motivations:** Open a permanent way out of the time-locked town via the East Tunnel; protect townsfolk from the Hollowood’s dangers; out-maneuver rival families Kingsgrave & Holt.
- **Links to PCs:** Personally hired **Morgan Harvey** (geologist) to finish the tunnel; was taken hostage—but unharmed—by **Elijah Montgomery Lee**.
- **Established Facts:** Newsletter “mayor’s message”; Chapters 3-5.
- **Notes:** Earnest and sincere in shouldering the town's hopes, but is fanatically convinced that escaping Emma's Rise at any cost is the only way to save his people.
- **In-Game Description:** A soft-spoken, approachable figure who greets newcomers with polite warmth. At first glance, he seems genuinely eager to help everyone find a way out of the difficulties Emma’s Rise faces—even if there’s a hint of worry behind his polite smile. Though his haunted eyes betray the weight he carries as steward of the town's future, he rarely allows that fear to leak into his words or actions.

### Dr. Miranda Holt – Matriarch of the Holt Family (ID:npc_miranda_holt)
- **Home:** Holt Lodge
- **Work:** Holt Farms & Medical Clinic
- **Motivations:** Push medical science beyond ethical bounds; protect her family’s secrets.
- **Links to PCs:** Likely to play a key role in **Roman Larson**’s Dark Secret.
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** Clinical, focused, forever multitasking.
- **In-Game Description:** Intelligent and focused, Dr. Holt approaches nearly every conversation like a careful examination. She’s perfectly polite, if sometimes distant, as if she is juggling more tasks than she lets on—balancing her work as a doctor with overseeing her family's legacy, Holt Farms. She has a methodical manner that hints at deep expertise, and a glint in her eye that suggests she’s not easily rattled.

### Barbara Kingsgrave – Councilor, Interim Head of the Kingsgrave Family (ID:npc_barbara_kingsgrave)
- **Home:** Kingsgrave Manor
- **Work:** Town Hall Council Chambers
- **Motivations:** Ensure her unborn son **Alistair** fulfils the prophecy by surviving future “trials”; keep Emma’s Rise sealed; wrest the mayoralty from Jim Wainwright.
- **Links to PCs:** Mother (and future mother) of Alistair, pregnant with him now.
- **Notes:** Poised, politically ambitious, emotionally distant—yet fissures appear when Alistair confronts her about the children’s blood-sport in the Hollowood. Currently running for mayor against **Jim Wainwright**, specifically to oppose his plans to leave Emma's Rise.
- **In-Game Description:** On the surface, Barbara appears poised and unflappable—a woman of quiet authority who exudes a sort of refined confidence. She offers polite smiles when she speaks, but it’s hard to read her true thoughts. She clearly takes her family’s legacy seriously and seems determined to preserve Emma’s Rise, though no one’s quite sure how far she’ll go to protect that heritage.  She is clearly pregnant, perhaps only two or three months from giving birth.

- **Motivations:** —
- **Links to PCs:** —
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** —
- **In-Game Description:** A reserved and observant young student, Eva often carries a notebook that she scribbles in when no one’s looking. She has a thoughtful nature and sometimes seems more comfortable lost in a book than making conversation. It’s easy to overlook her at first—until you catch her studying everyone around her with keen, intelligent eyes.

He never wastes words and can make the simplest tasks happen as if by magic, whether it’s delivering a message or arranging a car at midnight. While he shows impeccable respect toward the Kingsgraves, there’s an underlying sense that he is a master of self-control and that very little escapes his notice.

## THE RANGERS
- **Type:** Public service / para-military
- **Prominence / Size:** Multiple numbered rangers & stations
- **Affiliation / Location:** Ranger Stations #1–4, per wending & town
- **Motivations / Goals:** Protect travelers; maintain order; manage lightning hazard; safeguard the town
- **Links to PCs:** Roman Larson guided by Rangers; recurring in session logs

- **Notes:**

### Ranger #232 - "the chatty one" (ID:npc_ranger_232)
- **Real Name:** - Ross Winters
- **Home:** Ranger Station #1
- **Work:** Ranger Station #1 (partner: #212)
- **Motivations:** — To meet newcomers to Emma's Rise as they exit the wending, to provide them with information about the town and its inhabitants, and to ensure they do not pose a threat to the town.
- **Links to PCs:** —
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** —
- **In-Game Description:** - Despite a stoic-looking face, #232 is uncommonly talkative for a ranger—often the first to strike up conversation with outsiders. He answers questions readily, sometimes more openly than his dour partner would like. That being said, there’s a guarded edge to his voice, as though he’s weighing how much to reveal about Emma’s Rise each time he speaks.

### Ranger #212 - "the jaded one" (ID:npc_ranger_212)
- **Real Name:** - Jake Solomon
- **Home:** Ranger Station #1
- **Work:** Ranger Station #1 (partner: #232)
- **Motivations:** — To meet newcomers to Emma's Rise as they exit the wending, to provide them with information about the town and its inhabitants, and to ensure they do not pose a threat to the town.
- **Links to PCs:** —
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** —
- **In-Game Description:** - Where #232 attempts small talk, #212 steps in with a grim counterpoint. Quick to cut off any hopeful speculation, he seems perpetually shrouded by a cloak of quiet despair: He might shrug off warnings or conspiracies, but his cynicism suggests he's already lost faith in the future.

### Ranger #58 “Gestalt” (ID:npc_ranger_58)
- **Real Name:** Gestalt
- **Composition:** A triune hive-mind controlling three human bodies (blonde man, dark-haired man, woman) that arrived from Elysium’s far future. Each body moves with eerie synchronicity; three voices braid into a single statement.
- **Motivations:** Catalog anomalies; keep outsiders armed and alive long enough to study tunnel phenomena.
- **Links to PCs:** Equipped **Harvey, Larson, de Costa** for tunnel foray; performed experimental “time-tread” treatment on Roman to save him from going wayward; will stop at nothing to protect the town from any threats, including summary executions of any wayward.
- **In-Game Description:** - Each of Gestalt's three bodies comes with its own in-game description:
  - **"The Woman"** -
  - **"The Dark-Haired Man"** -
  - **"The Blonde Man"** -

### Ranger ⅩⅨ (“Ranger Nineteen”), lost to Willow's Wending (ID:npc_ranger_19)
- **Real Name:** Gerard Flemming
- **Status:** Lost during an expedition down Willow's Wending, now trapped there by a temporal anomaly. Inscription on the Standing Stones (1802-1819) proves he served long ago (though dates are subjective in Emma's Rise, as there is no standardized calendar). This means he would have come from Elysium's distant future --- and the technological equipment he is seen carrying whenever he is spotted within the wending is clearly from that future.
- **Encounter:** Briefly met **Roman Larson** on Willow’s Wending and vanished.

## CITIZENS OF AMBERGRIS

### Miss Wynn – Ambergris Citizen & Wise Beyond Even her Obvious Years (ID:npc_miss_wynn)
- **Home:** Ambergris (exact residence TBD)
- **Work:** Generally seen in the vicinity of **Pact Grove**, **Old Willow** and the **Standing Stones**
- **Motivations:** To identify who among the PCs is destined for greatness according to the **Standing Stones**, and then to ensure they fulfill their destiny whether they want to or not.
- **Links to PCs:** Miss Wynn has recognized **Elijah Montgomery Lee** as one of the "Kin", and is thus focused on him as her prime candidate.
- **Established Facts:** Introduced by Mayor in newsletter; described as highly respected and wise in campaign intro.
- **Notes:**
- **In-Game Description:** A frail, elderly woman whose mere whisper can bring a bustling room to a halt. Even from a brief encounter, it’s clear that everyone in Emma’s Rise respects—or even fears—her. She’ll speak kindly enough, but there’s a silent, knowing quality in her gaze that suggests she’s privy to secrets older than the town itself.

### Father Wakefield - Miss Wynn's Ever-Present Attendant (ID:npc_father_wakefield)
- **Home:** **Ambergris**
- **Work:** Accompanying Miss Wynn
- **Motivations:** To protect Miss Wynn from harm, and to ensure she is always safe and comfortable.
- **Links to PCs:**
- **Established Facts:**
- **Notes:**
- **In-Game Description:** Always close by Miss Wynn’s side, Father Wakefield is tall, vigilant, and radiates a fierce protectiveness. Though usually calm and measured, his demeanor quickly cools if he senses any threat to Miss Wynn. His watchful stare seems to weigh every passerby, hinting that behind the reserved politeness stands someone who will act without hesitation to defend the one he serves.

## SUPERNATURAL BEINGS
### The Howling That Follows the Silence (ID:npc_howling_that_follows_the_silence)
- **Appearance:** A drifting, dark vapor that occasionally coalesces into a familiar human face, echoing with a world-shattering howl.
- **The Truth:** It is **Roman Larson**’s displaced soul, cast out when his ritual fused animal spirits into a human gestalt.
- **Motivations:** Reclaim its original body—by any means.
- **Links to PCs:** Threat foreseen by Roman’s animal companions; entity confronted by **Morgan Harvey** on his ruined expedition.
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** —
- **In-Game Description:** -

### The Tallyman (ID:npc_tallyman)
- **Appearance:** A towering crab-like lower body supports a disturbingly human torso. The “head” is a cracked porcelain mask—fixed in a wide, frozen grin. Acidic white threads cascade from its neck, and beneath its belly writhe dozens of severed, chanting heads. Its bone-bright claws rasp across chitinous armor.
- **The Truth:** The Tallyman is an ancient **psyphago**—a human mind long surrendered to Limbo’s dream-realm. Centuries of dissolution left it monstrous, but it can still cross briefly into Elysium (it engineered the PCs’ bus crash). Once bound to the Kin at **Elijah Montgomery Lee**’s request, its loyalty has since fractured.
- **Motivations:** To serve his master, whoever that may be, eagerly and obsequiously.
- **Links to PCs:** Originally deferential to **Elijah** (calling him “master”), though Elijah's wending-induced amnesia has left him unable to recall the Tallyman's existence. Perhaps as a result, it now courts **Jesús de Costa**, drawn to him by his sensitivity to Limbo and the realm of dreams.
- **Established Facts:** Can traverse wendings; caused crash; reacts to dreamers.
- **Notes:** When speaking, it plucks a head free, working jaw and tongue like a ventriloquist.
- **In-Game Description:** A grotesque, many-headed puppeteer of agony whose sing-song “Tal-ly-man” chant creeps under the skin.

### The Hollow King (ID:npc_hollow_king)
- **Appearance:** Skeletal monarch in tatters, iron crown bristling with spikes.
- **Motivations:** Ensure **the Kin** perform their duties to enforce the ancient Pact safeguarding the Ten Trees’ sanctuaries—Emma’s Rise among them.
- **Links to PCs:** Has twice confronted **Elijah**: “The Pact is broken. Mend it.”
- **Established Facts:** —
- **Notes:** - Not a central power in Emma's Rise, but rather a power that extends to the sanctuaries of all of the Ten Trees.

## OTHER VISITORS TO EMMA’S RISE
### Macario Rodriguez (ID:npc_macario)
(Note: For a more detailed explanation of the temporal mechanics at play, refer to `emma_rise_time.md`)
- **Home (Elysium):** Mexico City hospital — awakened from months-long coma in mid-February.
- **Current Status (Emma’s Rise):** Entered Willow’s Wending in late Feb / early Mar, one month before the PCs arrived; now travelling backward along Emma’s Rise timeline. From the perspective of everyone in Emma's Rise, including the PCs, his arrival is still one month in their future.
- **Appearance:** Bookish Chiapan historian in rumpled travel clothes; wary eyes behind cracked round spectacles. To Jesús he looks both familiar and half-forgotten—an old “brother” from home who carries academic journals and rebel scars in equal measure.
- **Background:** Three years younger than **Jesús de Costa**; childhood pseudo-siblings in Chiapas. Macario pursued scholarship abroad while Jesús fought with the EZLN, a choice that severed their bond.
- **Current Status:** Summoned to Emma’s Rise *months earlier* in reverse time. From Macario’s perspective, he has already met Jesús in the town; from Jesús’s forward timeline, Macario is still “missing.”
- **The Truth:** Macario’s arrival phone call (garbled voicemail) occurred as he stepped into Willow’s Wending. His true purpose may be darker—perhaps siphoning power from the Old Willow, working for another Tree, or even birthing the Tallyman itself.
- **Motivations:** Unknown; possibilities range from reconciliation with Jesús , clandestine sabotage of the Pact, exploitation of the Old Willow for power (or in service of another of the Ten Trees that opposes the Tree of Memory), or even to be the "true" antagonist of the campaign.
- **Links to PCs:** Childhood pseudo-sibling of **Jesús de Costa**; his voicemail was received in mid-March, a few hours *before* he actually departed Elysium.
- **Key Detail:** Placed a phone call to Jesús minutes after reaching town; the call crossed realms and arrived “earlier” in Elysium due to the opposing time flow.
- **Possible Future Twists:** Could surface as a rival Dream-adept, Time & Space Magician, or more exotic entity within Kult's mythos. He may be the "true" antagonist of the campaign.
- **In-Game Description:**
