# Going Wayward: A Tale of What Might Have Been

_GM Note: This is a hypothetical, "alternate universe" version of what might have happened to Roman Larson if Gestalt's efforts to prevent him from going wayward after he was struck by lightning in Session 4 had failed._

## ROMAN

***ONE —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes.

Ranger Station #3.

A harness of silver coils clings to his chest. Three figures—one blond man, one dark-haired, one woman—lean in unison. *Gestalt.*

Roman remembers the gear-room only as a flash: golden lightning arcing from a bronze cog, his own skeleton briefly visible through his skin. Then nothing.

“Larson, can you hear us?”

He tries to sit. The blond’s pistol is already out.

“He's going wayward,” Gestalt warns, three voices braided. Roman does not know what that means, but fear surges. He swings his feet off the table.

Gestalt was waiting for that. A single shot; the world flowers red; then—

***TWO —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes.

He remembers bolting. He remembers the shot. He remembers the feel of his own temple caving in as the bullet mulched his brain.

“Larson, can you—”

Roman bolts again. Two steps, this time, before the shot, and the red, and the nothing.

***SEVENTEEN —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes.

He’s learned the pistol’s exact arc: the half-second stutter in Gestalt-Dark’s trigger pull. He’s learned how to answer “I’m fine” with lips that only tremble a little.

But each time he even grazes the doorframe, darkness falls in a haze of screaming red.

***ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes.

And he bargains: tells Gestalt about the cog-machine, about telluric faults, about the tunnel’s hidden chamber—everything he’s pieced together across failed loops.

The three faces blink, intrigued—until his mouth overruns itself, words foaming, days of experience pouring into seconds. Recognition dawns on triune faces.

They shoot him again.

***SIX HUNDRED FORTY-TWO —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes.

He now knows this station more intimately than any *being* has known any *thing*. It has become a doll-house he can rearrange at will. He knows the micro-tremor that precedes the lights buzzing; the exact creak pattern of each floorboard; the sleep-cycle of every rat in the crawlspace.

He escapes, effortlessly — leaving none alive — and tastes freedom for precisely thirteen hours, nine minutes, and four seconds before chronology’s elastic snap yanks him back to pine ceiling, silver harness, mirrored faces.

Gestalt never changes; nothing ever changes. Roman imagines he sees new fear in those six eyes, but he can't be sure—memory overlaps like oil slicks; maybe the fear is his own, reflected.

***ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FOUR —***
Madness trickles in each awakening like magma beneath a thinning crust.

He's lived lifetimes inside one thirteen-hour circuit, writing epic histories in dust, sculpting mausoleums of canned food, teaching Edgar the raven to declaim philosophy—each grand project erased when his eyes open again to Day Zero.

He’s eaten a bullet. He’s drunk cleaning fluid. He’s sliced his radial arteries, his femorals, his carotids.

None of it sticks. Death is merely a finger lifted from the record before it spins back to the first groove.

***SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIVE —***
He opens his eyes to ceiling-struts of rough pine and the stutter of fluorescent tubes. But he does **not** awake. Everything he was has been ground to talc under the wheel of unending return.

A laugh—thin, high, *wrong*—slips out before words remember what order is.

“Larson, can you hear us?”

He inhales—once, twice, *thricefourseventeen*—savoring the air like glass splinters. His pupils jitter, tracking things that happened yesterday-tomorrow. Outside, a crow calls in reverse, teaching him to speak in rewind.

Gestalt leans close, scanners whirring. He watches their faces melt and refreeze between heartbeats, a flip-book of concern, suspicion, terror. He has lived their deaths enough times to taste the texture of collapsing bone.

“Yes,” he says, tone surgically perfect—*remember, remember, this is the mask that fools the machines*—but a giggle bleeds through, warping the vowels. “I’m… o-kay.”

He does not dare blink—blinking costs days. Better to use his fingers, nails digging in until wet red heat floods his palms, tearing his eyes open as he tears his eyes out. Behind a curtain of blood a universe of centuries screams: canned-food kingdoms, raven philosophers, the pistol’s report tolling like the church bell at the end of eternity.

Gestalt’s many eyes quiver, horror dawning too late. The blond raises his weapon; Roman’s smile, slick with blood, is serene.

The trigger breaks. The world flowers red—

And time inhales for another breath.
