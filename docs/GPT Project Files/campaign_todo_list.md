## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Finish the Town Newsletter

### 2. Enhance the Foundry Experience
- Create a "my_kult4th_hacks" module for Foundry VTT to implement custom campaign features.
- Leverage the Greensock Animation Platform for immersive effects.
- Use Adobe tools to create soundscapes, animations, and visual assets.
- Balance time spent on visuals with campaign preparation.

### 3. Develop Tools for Lore and Creature Research
- Create files or tools to consistently document information on supernatural creatures, phenomena, and settings in Kult.
- Start by conducting targeted web searches, such as researching creatures associated with Metropolis.
- Organize findings into an encyclopedia or glossary for quick reference.

## Future Tasks

### 1. Intrigue Map Development
- Connect the various mysteries, factions, and characters once player backstories are available.
- Determine the relationships between Emma’s Rise, Ambergris, and their respective leaders.

### 2. Naming Refinements
