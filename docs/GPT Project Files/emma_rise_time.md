# Emma’s Rise Time Mechanics
*Reference sheet for internal lookup.*

## 1 · Core Model – “Ship Sailing the Wrong Way”
| Aspect | Emma’s Rise (“the ship”) | Elysium (“the shore”) |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Local flow | Forward - everyone ages, remembers, plans normally. | Forward. |
| Global drift | Entire realm moves **backward** along Elysium’s timeline at 1:1 speed. | — |
| Result | Stay one hour in ER → exit one hour **into Elysium’s past**. | — |

---

## 2 · Crossing the Boundary (Willow’s Wending)
- **Entry/Exit Node:** Always Ranger Station #1.
- **Personal timeline:** Continues forward for the traveler.
- **Realm offset:** On exit, traveler appears in Elysium at *T – Δt*, where Δt = time spent aboard the “ship.”

---

## 3 · Signals & Objects
| Item crosses from → | Effect |
|---------------------|--------|
| **Elysium → ER** | Arrives at matching traveler-local time (no reversal). |
| **ER → Elysium** | Emerges earlier by Δt (same offset as a returning traveler). |
| **Special cases:** Calls, radio, etc. may exploit the Wending as a conduit or require supernatural interference. |

## 4 · Memory & Causality Inside ER
- Residents experience coherent forward causality; no retroactive memory rewrites when new arrivals appear “later” in reversed time.
- Example: Rangers have no knowledge of Macario until he physically arrives one ER-month **after** the PCs.

---

## 5 · Practical GM/AI Guidelines
- **Date stamps:** Use *Elysium time* for logs; convert to ER-offset only when characters exit/enter the realm.
- **Future arrivals:** NPCs introduced later in Elysium can logically “precede” the party in ER by sending them through earlier.
- **Temporal hazards:** Lightning surges, ritual failures, or Wending anomalies may *alter* the 1:1 rate—but treat that as explicit plot events, not baseline behavior.
