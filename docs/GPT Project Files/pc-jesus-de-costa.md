## Dark Secret: "Returned from the Other Side"
De Costa was unconscious for a full year. During this time de Costa journeyed into Limbo and began to understand the Truth from his experiences there. De Costa recalls being stalked by a creature that called itself "THE TALLYMAN" (see below).  Later, he would recall that the circumstances of the accident (which predated any of his experiences in Limbo) bore all the hallmarks of an attack by the Tallyman, somehow able to influence Elysium despite being a creature of Limbo.

When de Costa finally woke in a Mexico City hospital, he found an old but functional polaroid camera sitting awkwardly on his chest. A polaroid photo was sticking out of it, depicting a man de Costa had never seen in his life. (This man would turn out to be ROMAN LARSON, another PC.)  De Costa soon learned he was the first and only of the nine victims to wake --- until, months later, one of the unconscious eight was reported missing from the hospital: MACARIO RODRIGUEZ (see below). Through putting his own tracking skills and contacts to work, de Costa was able to come to the conclusion that they were still alive. Where they could've gone with no money, no identification, and with no car was a mystery. It wasn't until he receieved a strange phone call from a garbled voice that he found where they may have ended up: Emma's Rise.

### The Truth
As yet undetermined.

## How Jesús Got to Emma's Rise
While in the coma, he was haunted by a neverending dream as his consciousness was shunted into the terrible and wonderous realm of Limbo. While there, he saw visions of many things that made him question reality even after he woke up 1 year later. One of these was the vision of a strange town with a name he couldn't quite remember. When he got the phone call and heard the name uttered by the voice on the other end, he knew that not everything he saw there was solely a dream.

## Timeline
- ~15+ Years Ago — De Costa establishes himself as a coyote (human trafficker) at the southern border, navigating Mexico’s violent ecosystem of gangs and cartels.
- ~11 Years Ago — Involved in a devastating car accident alongside eight others; all nine are hospitalized in critical condition, slipping into comas.
- ~10 Years Ago — De Costa awakens from his year-long coma, the only survivor to regain consciousness; finds an old Polaroid camera on his chest with a photo of a stranger (later identified as Roman Larson).
- Post-Coma Years — The other eight remain unconscious. De Costa is haunted by memories of Limbo, specifically a creature calling itself “THE TALLYMAN.” He gradually realizes that even the accident itself might bear the Tallyman’s influence.
- ~1–2 Months Ago — News breaks that one of the still-comatose individuals, Macario Rodriguez (a childhood friend), has inexplicably gone missing from the hospital; De Costa’s investigations confirm Rodriguez is alive but unaccounted for.
- Present Day — A garbled phone call mentions “Emma’s Rise,” echoing fragmented visions from De Costa’s time in Limbo; he departs for that remote town, determined to learn the truth behind the accident, the Tallyman, and Rodriguez’s disappearance.

## Significant NPCs
### The Tallyman
The Tallyman manifests as a giant crab-like creature with a more-or-less human torso, though its head is only a cracked, puppet-like mask bearing a frozen, split smile and hollow eyes that exude a palpable sense of amusement. Long, jagged claws glimmer like sharpened bone, while its chitinous, grinding carapace produces a constant rasping hum in motion. White silken threads fall from its neck to splay across its body, writhing like the tentacles of a jellyfish. The threads are highly caustic to the touch, leaving an acidic sting and burns wherever they brush flesh. The Tallyman's underbelly is a mass of writhing, tormented heads, trapped by the threads, through which the Tallyman can communicate. When not in use, the heads chant "Tallyman, Tallyman" in sing-song.

#### The Truth
The Tallyman is not actually native to Limbo, but is instead an ancient "psyphago": a human being who gave up his body to live permanently in the realm of dreams. Over the many centuries of its existence, the Tallyman lost its humanity, and is now indistinguishable from the many alien dream beings of Limbo... except for the fact that, for brief stretches, the Tallyman can leave Limbo and influence Elysium (as it did when it caused the crash). The Tallyman is currently working for the Kin (see ELIJAH MONTGOMERY LEE), and was tasked with bringing several of the PCs to Emma's Rise.

### Macario Rodriguez
About 3 years younger than De Costa, they both grew up in the same town in Chiapas and essentially had a sibling relationship despite being from different families. In their early 20s while De Costa was in a balaclava doing work for the EZLN, Rodriguez was studying history and planning to leave the country to attend an American university. De Costa saw this as a betrayal and basically cut off contact with him. Shortly before the accident, De Costa would've been 29 and it'd be the first time he saw Rodriguez in person for like half a decade. He would've been accompanied by a journalist who was writing an article about Chiapas and had Rodriguez onboard both due to having a bachelor's in history alongside being a Chiapas native. Coincidental meeting (probably), but at this point in his life De Costa was business first so he did his job as a coyote even though deep inside he wanted to verbally rip into him since he saw him as someone who gave up on their community. Obviously these feelings changed after the accident, and this person he's looking for essentially being like a brother to him would obviously push him on further.

#### The Truth
Macario Rodriguez was in fact summoned to Emma's Rise first -- that's why he went missing. The garbled phone call de Costa received was from Rodriguez, calling just as he was about to enter Willow's Wending to travel to Emma's Rise. At this point, Rodriguez' timeline reverses as he joins the town as it travels backwards through time: He finds de Costa already in town, having arrived several months earlier.  From de Costa's perspective, when he arrives in Emma's Rise, Rodriguez is nowhere to be found: It will take the town several months to catch up with the moment in the past where Rodriguez travelled the wending to Emma's Rise.
