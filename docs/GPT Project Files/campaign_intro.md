I intend to follow the scenario creation outline described in chapter 6 of the core rules.  The game will be set in an isolated small town deep in the mountains, accessible only by a single road.

During Session Zero, character creation will proceed as written for an Aware-tier game with four players, but they will be told of one constraint: 

"Whatever your Drive is, it must explain why you have travelled across the country to an isolated small town called 'Emma's Rise'.  Maybe you received a static-infused phone call from your dead sister that you traced to the town; perhaps you have nightly visions of the place; or a demon might have whispered its location into your ear.  Whatever it is, the only constraint on your characters is that at the start of the game something related to their Dark Secret compelled them to travel to Emma's Rise."

Beyond that, the players will be given complete carte blanche to choose from any of the Aware archetypes, and to decide how they want to handle Dark Secrets: Maybe each player creates their character in isolation and they arrive as strangers, or maybe some (or even all!) decide their characters know each other and arrive together, with shared (or related) Dark Secrets.

As a result of this wide-open uncertainty, we don't have much information to work with before Session Zero and the creation of the Intrigue Map (p. 167 of the core rules), which will ultimately guide the course of the campaign.
