# The Standing Stones

Five Standing Stones are located very close to the Hollowood, across the Old Bridge from the Old Willow itself.  They move physically from the realm of Amergris to Emma's Rise and back again in a shared stewardship, and contain living inscriptions that are always changing, from one or more mysterious "Powers That Be". (I'm thinking it might be Binah, the Archon of Community, endeavouring to save her lover Chokmah, Archon of Safety, who was destroyed long ago --- thus motivating her to catapult Emma's Rise backwards through time --- but I digress.)

The PCs are about to encounter the Standing Stones for the first time.  In addition to the standard wealth of information the five stones contain, they will also contain personalized revelations -- albeit cryptic ones --- for each of the PCs.

## 1. THE HONOR STONE
```html-simplified
<h1>The Guard</h1>
<table>
	A table listing the nine Rangers currently posted among the four Ranger Stations in Emma's Rise. Three columns give:
		- their number, e.g. `RANGER #232`
		- how many years ago they were posted, as an unfinished epigraph e.g., `-8 ~` _(instead of a date, to avoid the complexities of figuring out what year it would be in a town that's moving backwards in time)_
		- their station, e.g. `STATION #4`
</table>

<h1>The Lost</h1>
<table>
	A very long table that represents a memorial for all of the Rangers who have been lost since the Rangers were first intituted. Rather than try to fit them all onto the stone, I have an infinite scrolling panel covering the bottom half of the stone, which steadily displays them all. The columns are the same as above, except the second column now also shows how many years ago their were lost, combining them like a typical gravestone (e.g. `-24 ~ -12`).  I've sprinkled a few clues and curiosities into the list:
		- the earliest recorded date is `-352`, which I've decided is when the Rangers were first established in Emma's Rise
		- "Stations" were called "Posts" in the early days
		- early Rangers, Posts and Stations were given Roman numerals (e.g. `RANGER XIX`, `STATION IV`)
		- `STATION #5` is included next to a few names in the list; it appears for the last time about a decade ago
		- there are a few large groups of Rangers who all died in the same year, suggesting possible crises or catastrophes
</table>
```

# 2. THE WORLD STONE
```html-simplified
<h1>The Holy</h1>
<table>
	A table listing the Ten Trees, with three columns:
		- the name of the tree (e.g. `Old Willow`, `Old Hemlock`)
		- its symbolic meaning (e.g. `The Tree of Memory`, `The Tree of Sorrow`)
		- one of three cryptic words that suggest some political upheaval between the trees:
			- Old Ash is listed as `Belligerent`, and Old Juniper is listed as `Beseiged`, indicating the Ash/Juniper war that's been mentioned in rumors
			- Old Willow (the tree in Emma's Rise) is listed as `Entangled`, a reference to fate of the Old Willow depending on the actions of the PCs
			- all of the other trees are listed as `Resolute`, which helps to emphasize the others, and indicates a baseline of stability

	<!-- The first of the five revelations for each of the PCs. I decided to spread them out among the stones, so the PCs would have reason to explore them all.  This one is for `ALISTAIR KINGSGRAVE`, "The Prodigal Son" -->
Time winds tight around a gift within a gift
a father's confession, a Son's decision

On this choice hangs
heritage and blood
sanity and time

Speak truth and salt the earth
bring ruin to family and name
Or lie — and see how mercy
damns mind and memory both
</p>
```

## The Watch & the Letter
Alistair's revelation refers to a gift he just received from his mother, BARBARA KINGSGRAVE, right before visiting the Standing Stones: an old wristwatch of his father's.  The revelation should inspire him to take a second look, at which point he'll discover a hidden compartment containing a piece of futuristic technology that, when activated, plays a recorded message from his deceased father.  The voice reads the following:

"If you're hearing this... then you've come back to Emma's Rise."
"And... I'm... I'm already gone."

"You remember, the Hollowood. Not clearly — but somewhere... you know what you did."
"... What WE made you do."

"They told you it was prophecy."

"... It wasn't."
"I carved the words myself. 'Ten and two years' — I made it up."
"... I needed them to believe it. Someone had to believe it."

"The Trials weren't sacred. They were slaughter."
"Every child your age... locked in the Hollowood..."
"No way out... No food... No guidance... Just... survival."

"I gave you an edge, whenever I could. A compass. A knife. Food — hidden, where only you'd find it..."
"I told myself it was mercy..."

"... But it wasn't."
"It was fear."
"I was afraid of losing you... and even more afraid of facing what I'd done if you died."

"But... But you... KILLED... them ALL. You were twelve."

"And I let it happen! I set it in motion. I kept it going!"

"You deserve the truth."
"It wasn't prophecy."
"It was vanity, and pride, and murder."
"And I..."
"... I ... was its architect."

# 3. THE PEACE STONE
```html-simplified
<h1>The Realm Accords</h1>
	I. The dreamers of Ambergris and the wakened of Emma's Rise are bound to the Accords as they are bound to the Pact and these Stones.
	II. Stewardship of these Stones transfers upon the last stroke of moonset, seven suns per cycle, unless the Grove stands barren.
	III. The flow of trade shall be as the flow of the tide, to come and to go as the cycle demands.
	IV. No dreamer of Ambergris may spill blood on waking soil; no wakened of Emma's Rise may speak untruths in the domain of dreams.

<p>
	<!-- A second PC-revelation, this one for ELIJAH MONTGOMERY LEE, "The Kin" -->
Hollow-crowned servant
you shaped dreamstuff from clay and ash
but forgot the leash

The Pact weakens with each memory lost
Ten trees tremble as one withers

When your dreaming bows to you again
speak the hand written word
you've carried since birth

The Hollow King awaits your failure
</p>
```

# 4. THE LIFE STONE
```html-simplified
<h1>To Live</h1>
	I. Count the seconds between flashes: eight for ease, six for shelter, four for fire, two for terror.
	II. When white-fire dances, the heart must follow — shock what has been struck lest wayward go the spirit.
	III. Darkened lenses spare the living eye, rods of iron spare unliving land.

<p>
	<!-- A third PC-revelation: MORGAN HARVEY, "The Peerless Pariah" -->
Where seven currents collide
are stones they cannot see

Those you lost now walk in-between
carrying pieces of the puzzle

Beneath Emma's Rise, seek Emma's Fall
</p>

<p>
	<!-- A fourth PC-revelation: ROMAN LARSON, "The Wild Ranger" -->
You stole a shell not meant for fur
a name not meant for fang
A borrowed life in the borrowed skin
of He who hunts it still

Beast wove to beast
stitched instinct to hunger
until all saw with His eyes
But you are not Him

You are No One
You are Legion
</p>
```

# 5. THE PACT STONE
```html-simplified
<h1>The Pact</h1>
<p>
Cut thirteen daughters before their thirteenth spring.
Give them to the Hollowood, to root and crystal.
Thus the Pact is stoked and rekindled anew.
</p>
<p>
	In spring shall the Old Willow be kissed with fire,
	pilgrims of Birao shall be the fuel.
	Thus the Pact is stoked and rekindled anew.
</p>
<p>
  In ten and two years, gather your babes and set them to murder.
  For ten and two more, cast out the victor in exile.
  Thus the Pact is stoked and rekindled anew.
</p>
<p>
	Seal forever your wound to the mountain.
	Think not of departure, for you are mine.
	Thus the Pact is stoked and rekindled anew.
</p>

<p>
	<!-- The fifth and final PC-revelation: JESUS DE COSTA, "The Broken Dreamer" -->
A call crossed through dreaming
carried by memory carved in childhood skin

Awake before you, and wandered deeper
Now fluent in the silence you fear

Beware false friends who dream too clearly

And when next the veil turns glass
take someone waking with you
</p>
```
