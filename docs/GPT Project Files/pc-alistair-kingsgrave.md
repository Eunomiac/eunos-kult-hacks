# ALISTAIR KINGSGRAVE, "THE PRODIGAL SON"
Alistair is a Kingsgrave, one of the three founding families of Emma's Rise. He left Emma's Rise when he was twelve years old, his mind broken by some unremembered trauma -- his memories of the town were almost entirely erased. Upon arriving in Elysium, he was almost immediately institutionalized in an asylum, where he spent the next twelve years of his life.

## Dark Secret: "Returned from the Other Side"
During his years in the asylum, Alistair was singled out by a Madness Magician working as an orderly. He fed on Alistair's delusions, twisting them into fuel for his rituals. Then came the letter, sent to Alistair from an unknown sender.  It contained a legal notice informing Alistair that he had inherited family property in a place he didn’t remember: "Emma’s Rise". It also contained a black Amex with access to a well-padded checking account, and a deed to the property.

The next time the orderly worked his craft on Alistair, his head exploded.  His brain was apparently pulverized by a writhing mind-worm that emerged from the letter; Alistair glimpsed it only for a moment before it once again melded into the letter.

But before the Madness Magician died, something like magical feedback crackled between the two, linking their minds. And in that instant, Alistair remembered it: "Emma’s Rise". The town where he grew up.

The next thing Alistair knew, he was outside the asylum, covered in the orderly's blood, with no memory of escaping. Just that letter in his pocket. That letter had given Alistair everything: his freedom, his past, and a question he couldn’t ignore.

### Personal Drive: "Find the secret to mastering my madness"

### The Truth
As a child in Emma's Rise, Alistair participated in a gruelling and horrific rite of passage: a tournament among children akin to the Hunger Games, where they were abandoned into the Hollowood and forced into mortal combat until only one remained.  Alistair was the sole survivor, and the actions he had to perform in the Hollowood to secure his victory were too traumatic for him to bear: His mind fractured.

Nevertheless, the same prophecy that demanded the trials also demanded that the victor be sent into Elysium for twelve years, before being summoned back to Emma's Rise to occupy a position of leadership in the Kingsgrave family. Since Alistair was twelve years old when he participated in the trials and left Emma's Rise, and because Emma's Rise moves backwards through time, Alistair's arrival in the town as an adult coincides almost precisely with the time of his birth in Emma's Rise.  He will encounter his mother, BARBARA KINGSGRAVE, while she is pregnant with him.

Additonally, the "mind worm" that Alistair recalls never existed: It is Alistair's mind's way of concealing from him his own violent and murderous capabilities, as they were honed in the Hollowood --- Alistair killed that Madness Magician with his bare hands, but his mind clouded over the memory and replaced it with a fanciful delusion of a mind worm.

## How Alistair Got to Emma's Rise
Alistair knows the key to mastering his own mind lies in Emma’s Rise. Maybe his family holds the answers, maybe it’s something else. The certainty burns inside him, a whisper left behind from his brief connection with the orderly (and whatever that connection unlocked). He doesn't know why he's so sure—he only knows that he is. Besides, with the authorities undoubtedly hunting Alistair for the orderly's murder, it’s not like he has anywhere else to go.

## Timeline
- ~12 Years Ago — At age twelve, Alistair endures a horrific “rite of passage” in the Hollowood, battling other children until he alone survives. Traumatized, his mind fractures; soon after, he is sent away from Emma’s Rise for twelve years, in accordance with an unsettling prophecy.
- 12 Years in Elysium — Living outside Emma’s Rise (in Elysium), Alistair retains only faint, broken memories of his origins. His shattered mind quickly lands him in an asylum, where he spends almost all of his time while in Elysium.
- ~1–2 Months Ago — Receives a letter informing him of an inheritance in Emma’s Rise. In the midst of the Magician’s next “treatment,” Alistair experiences a violent psychic backlash: the orderly dies, and Alistair escapes the asylum under mysterious circumstances, letter in hand.
- Present Day — Driven by half-recovered memories and a desperate need for answers, Alistair returns to Emma’s Rise. There, he hopes to master his fractured mind and uncover the truth behind his past—unaware that he’ll soon encounter his mother, Barbara, who is pregnant with him as Emma’s Rise reels backward through time.

## Significant NPCs
### Barbara Kingsgrave
The current head of the Kingsgraves in Emma's Rise and Alistair's mother, she is currently running against MAYOR JIM WAINWRIGHT to take the mayorship from him. Because Emma's Rise moves backwards through time, when Alistair journeys to Emma's Rise in the present twelve years after leaving the town --- exactly the same amount of time he spent in the town as a child --- his arrival matches the date of his own birth fairly closely, and as such Barbara Kingsgrave is pregnant with him.

Moreover, to maintain the stability of the timeline, Barbara will have to send the letter to Alistair roughly one or two months from when he arrives in Emma's Rise -- i.e. the distance backwards in time at which he received the letter at the asylum.

### Alistair's "Watchers"
Unresolved at the moment. I'm thinking they might be phantoms/incarnations/otherwise related to the other kids he had to kill as part of the Hollowood trials.
