# ROMAN LARSON, "THE WILD RANGER"
Roman Larson is a park ranger for the Black Hills National Park and, as such, was hired to guide MORGAN HARVEY when the latter was invited to Emma's Rise.  Roman does have his own reasons for journeying to Emma's Rise, however: Hunted by a mysterious and powerful darkness, he believes Emma's Rise to be both a sanctuary and to contain answers that might help him finally understand the bestial presence inside him.

## Dark Secret: "Occult Experience"
Roman fled his home as a child after a strange encounter he does not fully recall. Whatever it was, it left him with the uncanny ability to perceive the language and even the thoughts of animals. Almost immediately, he became plagued with constant warnings by animals to constantly run and be on the move, to keep ahead of some terrible darkness that was hunting him.  Animals don't communicate with words, but with impressions, and the impression they gave of this hunter was translated by Roman's brain to mean "The Howling that Follows the Silence".

### Personal Drive: "Discover a way to improve my control of my ability"

### The Truth
Roman Larson never existed. That "strange encounter" he vaguely recalls was in fact his creation. For Roman is actually a gestalt personality comprised of thousands of animal consciousnesses working together in harmony to mimic a human, hoping to join divine humanity when it escapes the prison of Elysium.  As the story progresses, Roman's personality might begin to fragment as the animal consciousnesses that comprise it begin to fragment.


## How Roman Got to Emma's Rise
The animals "told" Roman of a sanctuary where he might find answers, called "Emma's Rise", but were less helpful on the question of how to get there. This problem was resolved when Roman received the call from MORGAN HARVEY asking to be his guide to Emma's Rise:  Harvey had GPS coordinates pinpointing its location.

## Timeline
- ~10–12 Years Ago — As a child, Roman experiences a cryptic, life-altering incident (his “strange encounter”). Fleeing home with only fragmented memories, he discovers an uncanny ability to perceive and understand animals—and learns they warn him of a predatory darkness called “The Howling that Follows the Silence.”
- ~8–9 Years Ago — Driven by constant animal impressions urging him to stay ahead of the encroaching threat, Roman leads a nomadic life, honing his wilderness skills and self-reliance.
- ~4–5 Years Ago — Settles in the Black Hills, where his affinity with wildlife helps him become a park ranger; quickly gains a reputation for resourcefulness and a near-mystical knack with animals.
- ~1–2 Months Ago — Hears repeated messages from the animals about a sanctuary known as “Emma’s Rise,” but struggles to locate it. This changes when Morgan Harvey contacts him, needing a guide based on precise GPS coordinates that match the animals’ warnings.
- Present Day — Accepts Harvey’s offer and heads toward Emma’s Rise, believing it may hold answers to his mysterious origin, the lurking darkness, and the bestial presence within him.

## Significant NPCs
### Roman's Animal Companions
Four animals play a more central role in Roman's life. All of them have accompanied him to Emma's Rise:
#### Beau
A silver-coated Labrador Retriever, Beau is all playful rebellion and wily charm, testing Roman’s patience with a mischievous glint in his eye yet always returning with unwavering loyalty
#### Bella
A fiercely protective Rottweiler, Bella came into Roman’s life under tragic circumstances and remains his steadfast guardian, her watchful gaze hinting at deeper knowledge
#### Morgan
A Morgan horse, "Morgan" stands apart with quiet judgment, meeting Roman’s every move with a cool, calculating stare, while a bribe of beets can briefly transform that wary detachment into a fleeting warmth
#### Edgar
An enigmatic raven draped in glossy black feathers, Edgar appeared only recently: He balances dramatic flair with unsettling curiosity, hovering around Roman as if bearing an omen—or a punchline.
### The Howling That Follows the Silence
The Howling That Follows the Silence is a creature that hunts Roman Larson. Its existence was revealed to him by the animals, who communicate only in impressions. Roman saw it as a being of darker darkness, and heard its bloodthirsty howl.

I'm thinking of having this creature be the "real" Roman: The animals excised Roman's consciousness from his body as they took over his mind, and this "creature" is really Roman's human side, trying to regain control of his body.

While it _could_ be "all in his head', I've also established that MORGAN HARVEY encountered the same creature in the caverns beneath Kentucky.  So, if it is a manifestation of Roman's psyche, then we need a way to explain how it could exist outside of Roman's mind, and why it would stalk MORGAN HARVEY in Kentucky despite the two not knowing each other.
