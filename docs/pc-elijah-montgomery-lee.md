# ELIJAH MONTGOMERY LEE, "THE KIN"
Elijah is a member of a mysterious, nomadic people who are accustomed to travelling the wendings between sanctuaries of the Old Trees, named "the Kin". Unfortunately, one side effect of the wendings is that whenever you return to Elysium from one, all memories of what happened on the wending and what happened in the sanctuary at the other end are erased:  Elijah only ever knows his current mission, and even then only in vague terms.

## Dark Secret: "Pact With Dark Forces"
Elijah knows that his mission is to renew the "Pact", which according to the HOLLOW KING (see below) has been broken and needs to be restored. Elijah doesn't know the details of how to do this, however, but the Hollow King doesn't seem to think this will be an obstacle.  Nevertheless, because of Elijah's spotty memories of his own people, he can't be sure what their ultimate goals or objectives are --- only that he took an oath to faithfully support them.

### Personal Drive: "Achieve further power or success"

### The Truth
As yet undetermined.

## How Elijah Got to Emma's Rise
After an encounter with the Hollow King on Ash's Wending, Elijah was taken directly to the entrance to Willow's Wending (leading to Emma's Rise, the sanctuary of the Old Willow). As a result of leaving a wending to enter Elysium, Elijah lost all memory of the events on Ash's Wending and the sanctuary of the Old Ash.

## Timeline
Largely unknown, with the gaps in Elijah's memory. He knows he appeared out of Ash's Wending in the present day, but is uncertain how long he was in the sanctuary of the Old Ash.

## Significant NPCs
### The Hollow King
A tall, skeletal figure wrapped in tattered robes and wearing a wrought-iron crown atop a naked skull, the Hollow King is the being to which the Kin are bound, and to whom oaths to preserve the Pacts that maintain the wendings and sanctuaries for all ten Old Trees are made. When he appears, the Kin obey.

### The Tallyman
Described more fully in JESÃšS DE COSTA's summary, the Tallyman is a psyphago who is likewise bound to the Kin and to the Hollow King. He was tasked by Elijah himself with bringing four people to Willow's Wending (i.e. the other PCs), which the Tallyman did.  Elijah, however, has forgotten all of this --- he has no idea the Tallyman serves him, and I am looking forward to a scene where, thinking he's being hunted by the Tallyman, the creature instead bows to him and asks for validation that he did a good job.
